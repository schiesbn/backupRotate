This program was written for personal usage. So don't expect any active
development beside adjustments to my own needs. Feel free to reuse it and
adjust it to your own needs.

This small program allows you to specify a 'path' where your backups
are located and a 'number' of backups you want to keep. The program will read
the directory 'path' and delete all files beside the latest 'number' of files.
The list of files will be sorted alphabetically, the program assumes that the
oldest file is at the top of the list and the newest file is at the bottom of
the list.
